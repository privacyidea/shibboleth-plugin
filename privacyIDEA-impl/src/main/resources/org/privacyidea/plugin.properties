## Notes:
#  Required is:
#  - plugin.id
#  - plugin.version

#  Optional:
#  - plugin.url.0 - These are the URLs where the plugin compatibility property files (below) are located.
#  Multiple locations may be specified to allow for redundancy.
#   - plugin.version
#   - plugin.license
#   - plugin.modules.required (space-delimited list) - The names of any modules which
#     need to be enabled before the plugin installer will install this plugin.
#     This is the only sense in which plugins may "depend" on other plugins;
#     it's the module(s) exposed by those plugins that are identified as required.
